# Project Description

Activate Company was established in 2012 and is known for providing financial services to individuals and businesses across the world. **In 2024, the company had 5,654 active employees in the UK, but 980 employees left the UK branches that year.** This shows that 17% of the workforce exited, which is a **408% increase** compared to that of 2023.

This sharp rise in employee exits has caused a serious problem for the company. Replacing these employees has been extremely expensive. In 2024 alone, the **UK branches spent £13.7 million on hiring and training new workers** to fill the gaps left by those who left.

This project was carried out to understand why so many employees are leaving and what are the contributors to departmental turnovers. 

<br/>

### The main objectives are to:

* Analyze the **financial impact** of employee turnover.

* Identify the departments with the **highest turnover**.

* Examine the reasons why employees are leaving these departments.

* Provide **recommendations** to reduce turnover.

# Executive Summary

Activate Company has been losing a lot of money because many employees are leaving. In 2024, the company spent £13.7 million to replace employees who left. This is a 493% increase from 2023. The Customer Support and Sales departments were the biggest contributors to this cost. Together, they made up more than half of the £13.7 million spent on replacing workers in 2024.

The company no longer has employees who have been there for long-term but employees who have been there for less than 3 years . This shift happened because many people left for similar reasons (low salaries, poor onboarding, no promotion path)

### 1b. What is the financial impact of employee turnover department-wise?

<div align = "center">  <img src = "Overall%20Financial%20Impact.png"> </div>

This surge was primarily driven by two key factors:

**High Exit Volume**: In 2024, the company saw a substantial rise in employee exits, particularly in the Customer Support and Sales departments, both of which contributed significantly to the overall cost.

**Increased Hiring Costs**: With more employees leaving and more roles to fill, the costs associated with recruitment, training, and productivity loss also escalated sharply.
