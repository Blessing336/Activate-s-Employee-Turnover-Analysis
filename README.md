# Project Description

Activate Company was established in 2012 and is known for providing financial services to individuals and businesses across the world. **In 2024, the company had 5,654 active employees in the UK, but 980 employees left the UK branches that year.** This shows that 17% of the workforce exited.

This sharp rise in employee exits has caused a serious problem for the company. Replacing these employees has been extremely expensive. In 2024 alone, the **UK branches spent £13.7 million on hiring and training new workers** to fill the gaps left by those who left.

This project was carried out to understand how the Activate Company is doing and why so many employees are leaving. 

<br/>

### The main objectives are to:

* Analyze the **financial impact** of employee turnover.

* Identify the departments with the **highest turnover**.

* Examine the **reasons why** employees are leaving these departments rapidly.

* Provide **recommendations** to reduce turnover.

# Executive Summary

Activate Company faced a severe retention crisis in 2024, spending **£13.7 million on replacing 980 employees**, a 493% increase from 2023. The **highest turnover was seen in Customer Support and Sales**, with Customer Support alone costing the company £4.4 million, accounting for 32% of the total replacement cost. Sales followed, contributing £2.95 million, emphasizing the urgent need for intervention in these departments.

The primary reasons for exit are **low salary, lack of promotion paths, poor onboarding, and weak mentorship participation**. Customer Support and Sales again topped the list, with 35% of exits in Customer Support and 26% in Sales linked to low pay. The absence of structured promotion paths also pushed 28% of Customer Support staff and 26% of Sales staff to leave, feeling their efforts led nowhere. Poor onboarding further compounded the problem, with 35% of Customer Support exits and 26% of Sales exits driven by inadequate training and lack of guidance.

Mentorship gaps played a significant role in early exits too, with 450 unmentored Customer Support employees (32%) and 322 unmentored Sales employees (23%) not mentored, highlighting a major void in support for frontline staff.

**Immediate action is required to address pay structure, career advancement opportunities, and onboarding processes** to stabilize the workforce and reduce financial losses.

<br/><br/>

* **No Mentorship Participation:** 2024 data shows that the departments with the highest number of employees who were not called to participate in mentorship programs aree **Customer Support and Sales**. These two departments also have the **highest number of exits and the highest replacement costs**, showing a strong link between poor mentorship and high turnover.

In Customer Support alone, 450 employees, which is 32% of all unmentored staff, did not have a mentor. Sales followed closely, with 322 employees (about 23% of unmentored staff) missing out on mentorship. 

<br/><br/>

The most affected department was Customer Support, where 35% of employees who exited cited low salary as the primary reason for leaving.

<div align = "center">  <img src = "No%20Promotion%20Path%20Reason.png"> </div>

<br/><br/>

* **Poor Onboarding:** Many in 2024 also said they were not properly supported when they first joined. This problem was a common reason for exit, especially in departments that deal directly with customers (Customer Support Staffs and Sales People).

# Recommendations

* **Always receive ongoing feedback from current employees (Quarterly?)**

* **Address pay discrepancies in departments, especially Customer Support**: Conduct a market salary analysis to align compensation with industry standards, focusing on frontline roles in Customer Support and Sales.

* **Develop clear promotion pathways across all departments**: Create structured career paths that outline specific milestones and promotion criteria for each role, especially in Customer Support and Sales. Establish quarterly reviews for mid-level employees to discuss career progression, identify skill gaps, and provide targeted training opportunities.

* **Revamp onboarding programs with department-specific focus**

* **Strengthen Mentorship Programs to Support Frontline Staff**: Establish a mandatory mentorship program in Customer Support and Sales. Pair new hires with experienced staff to provide ongoing guidance.


# Key questions for stakeholders prior to project advancement

* Beyond exit interviews, has the company collected ongoing feedback from current employees regarding their satisfaction with pay, promotion paths, and mentorship opportunities?

* **Long-Term Workforce Planning**: With the long-term employees phased out, what is the long-term vision for building a more stable, experienced workforce? Are stakeholders open to developing tailored retention plans for critical roles to prevent further losses?
