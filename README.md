# Project Description


# Executive Summary

Activate Company has been losing a lot of money because many employees are leaving. In 2024, the company spent £13.7 million to replace employees who left. This is a 493% increase from 2023. The Customer Support and Sales departments were the biggest contributors to this cost. Together, they made up more than half of the £13.7 million spent on replacing workers in 2024.

The company no longer has employees who have been there for long-term but employees who have been there for less than 3 years . This shift happened because many people left for similar reasons (low salaries, poor onboarding, no promotion path)
